# AIRBNB
Project Description: Airbnb Dataset Cleaning and Analysis  This project focuses on cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing an Airbnb listings dataset to make it suitable for exploration and insights extraction. The main steps include:
Data Cleaning

Removing invalid or negative values (e.g., negative minimum nights).
Handling missing values in important columns.
Standardizing data formats (e.g., converting price and service fee columns from strings with $ to numeric types).
Stripping unnecessary spaces from text fields.

Data Transformation
Converting categorical fields into appropriate types for analysis.
Converting date fields to datetime objects for time-based analysis.
Outlier Detection and Handling
Identifying outliers in numeric fields like price, latitude, longitude, and minimum nights.
Deciding whether to remove or cap extreme values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generating visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots.
Understanding patterns in pricing, host activity, and geographic distribution of listings.

Insights and Reporting
Summarizing key trends in listings, pricing, and host behavior.
Providing a clean dataset ready for further analysis or modeling.

Goal:
To transform raw Airbnb data into a clean, structured, and analyzable format that supports data-driven decisions or predictive modeling.
